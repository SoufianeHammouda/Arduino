This code is for controlling a door lock system using an Arduino. Here's a quick description of what the code does:

It includes several libraries for different components such as a LiquidCrystal display, RFID reader, SPI communication, and a servo motor.

It initializes the LiquidCrystal display, RFID reader, and sets up some pins for LED indicators and a servo motor.

The system uses RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology to control access to the door. It defines an array of RFID serial numbers (accessGranted) that are allowed access.

There are two positions for the servo motor (lockPos and unlockPos) that control the locking and unlocking of the door.

The code continuously checks for RFID cards or tags placed near the reader. When a card is detected, it reads the card's ID number and checks if it matches any of the allowed access IDs.

If the detected card's ID matches an allowed ID, it unlocks the door by moving the servo motor to the "unlock" position and turns on a green LED.

If the detected card's ID does not match any of the allowed IDs, it denies access, locks the door by moving the servo motor to the "lock" position, and turns on a red LED.

The LCD display provides status messages, and the system waits for the next RFID card to be placed near the reader.

The loop continuously repeats, checking for RFID cards and updating the display and lock status as necessary.

In summary, this code creates a simple RFID-based door lock system with visual feedback using LEDs and an LCD display. It grants or denies access based on the RFID card's ID number and controls the door's lock mechanism using a servo motor.
