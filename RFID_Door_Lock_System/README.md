Project Name: Arduino RFID Door Lock System

Description:
This Arduino-based RFID Door Lock System is designed for securing access to a physical space or door using RFID cards or tags. The system incorporates various components, including an RFID reader, servo motor, LCD display, and status LEDs, to provide controlled access.

Key Features:

Access Control: Only authorized RFID cards are granted access to the secured area.
Visual Feedback: Status information is displayed on an LCD, and LEDs indicate access status.
Servo Motor: A servo motor controls the locking mechanism, providing physical security.
Customizable: Easily configure authorized RFID card IDs and servo motor positions to suit your needs.
Debugging Support: Use the serial monitor for debugging and monitoring system activity.
Usage:

Place an authorized RFID card/tag near the reader.
The system checks the card's ID against a list of authorized IDs.
If the card is authorized, the door lock is opened using the servo motor.
Visual feedback is provided via LEDs and an LCD display.
Hardware Requirements:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
RFID reader module
Servo motor
LCD display (I2C)
Status LEDs
RFID cards or tags
Installation and Configuration:

Ensure proper connections between components.
Upload the provided Arduino code to your board.
Configure authorized RFID card IDs in the code.
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
